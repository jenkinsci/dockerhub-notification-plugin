CloudBees Docker Hub/Registry Notification
================

This plugin provides integration between 
* Jenkins and Docker Hub
* Jenkins and Docker Registry 2.0
* Jenkins and Nexus 3

It does so by utilizing webhooks to trigger one (or more) Jenkins job(s).
This allows you to implement continuous delivery pipelines based on Docker in Jenkins.

When Jenkins receives a notification of an updated image that is a web-hook from
Docker Hub, it triggers all jobs that have the Docker Hub
trigger enabled and use the Docker image as part of the build. A
Docker Hub Pull build step is provided to retrieve the latest image from
Hub.

# Configuring Docker Hub

On the Jenkins Configure Global Security page add an api key.

Configure your Docker Hub repository with a webhook to your public jenkins instance `http://JENKINS/dockerhub-webhook/{api-key}/notify`

In your <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">hub.docker.com</a> repository, you can find the "webhooks" section and point it to your jenkins instance:

# Configuring Docker Registry 2.0

Follow Docker Registry 2.0 [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/registry/notifications/) on how to configure registry so that it would send notifications to `http://JENKINS/dockerregistry-webhook/{api-key}/notify`

The simplest viable configuration looks like this:
```
  notifications:
    endpoints:
      - name: jenkinslistener
        url: http://JENKINS/dockerregistry-webhook/{api-key}/notify
        timeout: 500ms
        threshold: 5
        backoff: 1s
```

# Configuring Azure Container Registry

You can find a detailed guide on how to configure webhooks on ACR on
[docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-webhook).
Use `http://JENKINS/acr-webhook/{api-key}/notify` as a "Service URI".

# Configuring Sonatype Nexus 3 Registry

Follow the instructions at [help.sonatype.com](https://help.sonatype.com/repomanager3/webhooks/enabling-a-repository-webhook-capability).
Use `http://JENKINS/nexusregistry-webhook/notify?host=REGISTRYHOSTNAME` as URL

# Examples

Payloads submitted by the hub:

* [Payload from your own repository](src/test/resources/own-repository-payload.json).
* [Payload from a public repository](src/test/resources/public-repository-payload.json).

Payloads submitted by the registry:

* [Payload from your own registry](/src/test/resources/private-registry-payload-1-repository.json).

The plugin can be tested with

```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/jenkins/dockerhub-webhook/{api-key}/notify -d @src/test/resources/public-repository-payload.json
```
